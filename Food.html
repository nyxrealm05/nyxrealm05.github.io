                    <p>A classic Bolivian recipe and a favorite one of what my mom makes. A staple in my household at all hours, we eat these up all the time and they bring such nostalgia,
                        particularly when we get lucky and actually have authentic Bolivian cheese with us to use its a completely different experience, 100% better but we make do without it.
                    Recently, my mom has been adding some dice ham from Sam's club in the middle and it makes it even better my god sooo good!! Must eat warm and with some coffee! </p>

                    <p> Who said oats can only be sweet? A reccurent breakfast I have made when I feel that I need to up my fiber and protein intake to get a fresh start to my day. This is just one of the many 
                        customizations I have made to my savory oatmeal recipe and its a classic American breakfast in a bowl. I have recently loved topping with some ketchup and laoganma
                        (chinese chili crisp for those unaware) and it always hits it elevates every dish to a whole new level.

                    <p> On one of my many online grocery shopping ventures on Weee app, I discovered these and purchased. Let me just say, I became enlightened and NEEDED to learn how to make them.
                        I have made these atleast 3 times already and they are still as good as I remember. A bit of a labor od love with all the folds but they matter because they give that flaky 
                        interior that is integral to making this chinese street food. Theres Indian versions too I have found but ya know food is all connected. Carby but 100% worth it and its healthy cause it has greens :).

                    <p> Who said oats can only be sweet? A reccurent breakfast I have made when I feel that I need to up my fiber and protein intake to get a fresh start to my day. This is just one of the many 
                        customizations I have made to my savory oatmeal recipe and its a classic American breakfast in a bowl. I have recently loved topping with some ketchup and laoganma
                        (chinese chili crisp for those unaware) and it always hits it elevates every dish to a whole new level.

                    <p> As you can see, there was a period of time where I really liked bang bang sauce hehe but for good reason. My friend and I had found a hispanic food truck event
                        on facebook and mainly went to buy some Bolivian Saltenas but was so pleasantly surprised by this vegan food truck that sold Bang Bang tacos. The taste was soo good That
                        for the entire week I couldn't get them out of my head and finally got all the ingredients to re-create it and, not to toot my own horn or anything, but it came out exactly
                        as I wanted it. This was really a whim on my part so there wasn't even a recipe just the previous reference and I went for it. Was actually pretty easy to make 
                        and I loaded it up with cilantro cause I love it and  bang bang sauce and it was fantastic.

                    <p>Another recipe for the bang bang fanatic!! Ths one was pretty simple honestly it was also on a whim I was kind of going for noodle bowl but also cause I bought those cabbages to 
                        make the asian coleslaw from the bang bang tacos and now I needed to use them before the go bad so this was the outcome. Also the chicken seasoning came because I became
                    obsessed with this combo from this rice recipe i found, mainly the tropical seasoning with the rosemary butter it just makes chicken sooo tasty. Added too much noodles in the picture so will add less next time. </p>

                    <p>A comfortable and easy noodle dish to make when you need something to warm your soul but do not have the time to make everything from scratch. Its always great to have some frozen, already prepped
                        chicken and you know how I love my air fryer so just throw the chicken in there to get it nice and charred. Top with veggies of your choice, at the time the only greens I had was romaine

                    <p> One of my favorite desert recipes and a classic in my family. I love the moistness of the cake and the lightness of the whipped cream frosting. Its such an easy desert
                        to make too since you cut out the time to make the cake from scratch but feel free to make it from scratch if you want to. I've made this cake but using
                        a chocolate cake mix and it was pretty good though i recently saw a thai tea tres leches that looks phenomenal and I will be bringing that to Friendsgiving this year!

                    <p> If you can't tell by now, I am a big fan of easy recipes. That's why this recipe I made for my tiramisu-loving friend vivi is a fanstastic option. It comes together so easily
                        and I was actually requested by my friends to bring it for our Halloween party this year so I will be tripling this so everyone can have some. I don't have much of a reference
                        to authentic tiramisu but heck this is easier to make so I'll just stick with this.

                    <p> Made this dessert a couple years back after being really curious as to why Saiki k loved it so much and I became enlightened after trying it. I love new ways to consume coffee and this
                        is definetly one of the more unique ones and tasty ones! The cold helly texture is lovely and when you eat it with the cream mixture its soo rich and it helps balance out the bitterness 
                        from the coffee. You can top with coffe beans, chocolate shavings, cherries, condensed milk and more. Will definitely be making again soon!

                    <p> This recipe is a bit unique in that I had the original creator's video downloaded and thought to use this instead of the recipe card. To get the recipe, just pause and 
                        read from the written recipe shown in the beginning. Can guarante that this recipe is sooo good one of, if not, THE best carrot cake recipes I have ever tried its spiced and moist and the cream cheese frosting is delectable and the best pairing
                        for a carrot cake. Will be making again soon I've got carrots to use up!
